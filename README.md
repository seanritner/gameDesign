## Theory
- Why the UX discussion around Elden Ring is flawed: [https://uxdesign.cc/why-the-ux-discussion-around-elden-ring-is-flawed-9dd4aba2cc6f]
  - Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things: "Games, a category in which designers deliberately flout the laws of understandability and usability. Games are meant to be difficult; in some games, part of the challenge is to figure out what is to be done, and how."
